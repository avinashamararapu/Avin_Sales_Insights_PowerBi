# Avin_Sales_Insights_PowerBi

Problem statement
----------------------------------------------------------
Avin Hardware is a business with numerous outlets across India that provides computer hardware & peripheral Manufacturers to its customers. The company's sales director is having a lot of trouble understanding how the business is doing and what challenges it is now experiencing because sales are below expectations and steadily falling. Additionally, as a result of human nature, whenever the sales director calls the regional managers to inquire about the state of the market and sales, they tend to sugarcoat the information and send a boatload of Excel files rather than providing the straight story, which only served to aggravate the sales director. The obvious cause of the annoyance is that people find it uncomfortable to read numbers from Excel files.

Solution
-------------------------------------------------------
Sales director of the AltiQ hardware, decided to build a PowerBI Dashboard for converting the data into visual representation to make data driven decisions. So, he hired a team of data people to complete this task.

AIMS Grid
